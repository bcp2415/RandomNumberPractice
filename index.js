/* Modify the code above to:
1) Generate random integers from 1 - 100. Click 'Run' multiple times to make sure 1 and 100 can be generated, but NOT 0.

2) Generate random integers between -5 and 0, but NOT including 0. Click 'Run' until you verify that -5 can be generated but NOT 0.

3) Challenge: Generate random integers from 20 - 30.

Be sure to click 'Run' several times to verify your code generates random numbers properly.
